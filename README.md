# The "Dead Characters" Collection

We've played a lot of characters, and many of those characters, or the campaigns they were in, have died. 
A common use for these dead characters is to use their builds as NPCs in later campaigns, either reskinned or as cameos.
While we're sure that we're not the only group with this tradition, we thought we'd share our collection of dead NPCs and player characters
through this compendium pack.

## Content

In terms of content, we have no content (yet) because I just made this empty repo. I have a ton of backlog to work through but need to learn how to plug it in.
What it will be are several compendium packs containing both journal entries (for cross-system compatibility) and character sheets (if the appropriate system for the character sheets is present).

Someday there will be a chart here outlining how many characters of each system are available.

I also want to have a tagging system in place of some kind. Like a spreadsheet (or csv?) that lets you look stuff up because there's a lot going on.

## Contributing Your Dead Characters

One day I want to let people contribute characters to this collection. We'll see how that goes it will be a decent bit of work.
